# Artycle Application

My own fullstack development (backend, front, deploy).

Django + PostgreSQL + JS + AWS S3.

Hosting on Heroku, so first connection to site can takes about 15 sec (heroku use dynos containers). By the way AWS S3 and heroku server locate in USA. It also can be reason of little delay.

Project in development status, some bugs are possible.
